    "description": "This example is based of the Perlin Noise Example from the lecture(slide 36). I really liked the look of it, so I expirimented with it. What I wanted to do is, to add some movement to the landscape. Now every single layer of the landscape is moving differently due to the offset. The coding process wasnt very complicated because some parts were already there from the example. I was chaching values and the look of the landscape which brought me to my second noise example."

    "description": "This project is based of the Perlin Noise as well and an extention of the fist example. Since I was playing aroung with the Value I found different variations of the noise and came to the conclusion that i wanted to create a mountain landscape. Moving aswell. I changed the color a bit and also the values when the layers where generated. To understand what changed, I added comments behind every important line of code. That way everyone can understand what the values do."
